# Feature Branch Plan – YouTube Workflow

> Working branch: `feature/youtube-workflow`

This document tracks the shared understanding for the YouTube workflow effort. Keep it current so we have a single source of truth even if assistant context resets.

## Standing Instructions
- Keep this project plan synchronized with the latest decisions, scope changes, and progress at the end of each working session.
- Log key Codex conversation snippets with `scripts/append_conversation_log.py` so we retain historical discussions.
- Update outstanding tasks when work is started, blocked, or completed.
